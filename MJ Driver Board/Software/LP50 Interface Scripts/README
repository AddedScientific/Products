Copy and paste the folders so that they intersect with LP50.

Two files need modification.

LP50\Configuration\config\ParameterConfig.par
LP50\Configuration\config\preAssembly.cs

Preassembly could likely be replaced but check that there are no excluded inclues.

ParameterConfig needs all the X128 subscript parameters moved over.
